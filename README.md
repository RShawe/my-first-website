# My first webpage

Welcome

This project is to create and test out a basic website using HTML and CSS. 
It is composed of three pages whose content provides wikipedia links to HTML5,
CSS3, JavaScript, Cloud9, Git, GitHub, Python, django, Heroku, MySQL, Flask and MongoDB.

The rationale is to become familiar with working using Command Line Interface
through the Terminal on Cloud9 and to store a copy of local repositories on a remote server,
in this instance GitHub. It is also to familiarise with git commands.
